# Rick Roll 13 for Mac

* Author: K1NGDM @mathewcostello Follow me on Twitter!
* Version: 1.0

## Description

Adds a new cron job that will go out to a browser and load Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up every 13th minute
* copies the crontab
* adds our youtube link for every 13th minute
* installs the modified crontab
* closes all terminal windows
* deletes bash history

## Requirements

Mac OS High Sierra or previous. May prompt for adding the crontab on newer OS's (Mojave and further) which is not a show stopper you just need to have it on and unlocked in this case. This issue has already been brought up so don't even say anything about it unless you have a cool solution. New version should have this fixed if we can get around it.
